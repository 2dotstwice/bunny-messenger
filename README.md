AMQP Bunny Messenger
====================

> :warning: This is a work-in-progress thing, do not use it in production.

An alternative AMQP transport for [Symfony Messenger](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html).
Based on [Bunny](https://github.com/jakubkulhan/bunny) library, it creates a proper consumer and uses time-limited
blocks.
